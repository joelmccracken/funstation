# funstation
workstations are like soooo yesterday


# Planning

## immediate
principles:
- move practical pieces from dotfiles repo
- ensure short-term compatibility with dotfiles repo
Q how do I integrate with awkward parts of dotfiles repo?
especially pieces that impact files ??
how do i test this?

?? seems impossible... would rming dotfiles dir be a good next step?
or trying to make sure that, if I do make a change, it is a good change?


tasks:
- write funstation bin script to house running needs
- add this repo bin to the front of path

short term, start handling immediate needs
- inboxes
- dirty repos
- commands running regularly
- system status metrics/information

principles
- ensure good tests
  - quick to run
  - employ fakes around seams
- ensure

medium term, move various pieces from dotfiles repo to this repo

long term, explore more interesting things
- extract into separate libraries
- make as much as possible be pure fp
- literate programming (?)
- vm integration testing

## long term

- explore pure fp style code
