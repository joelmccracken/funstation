workstations are like soooo yesterday


# Planning

## immediate
principles:
- move practical pieces from dotfiles repo

tasks:
- ensure short-term compatibility with dotfiles repo
Q how do I integrate with awkward parts of dotfiles repo?
especially pieces that impact files ??
how do i test this?

?? seems impossible... would rming dotfiles dir be a good next step?
or trying to make sure that, if I do make a change, it is a good change?

- add this repo bin to the front of path




## long term

- explore pure fp style code
